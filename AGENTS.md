# AGENTS.md

Guidance for agents and automation working in this repository.

## Project Positioning

`pvectl` is a personal HomeLab Proxmox VE CLI. It wraps the Proxmox VE API
through `go-proxmox` and exposes resource-oriented commands for daily VM/QEMU
and LXC operations.

Keep the tool small and predictable. Do not turn it into:

- a Web UI
- a server mode or HTTP API
- a multi-user control plane
- an RBAC, audit, billing, or policy platform
- a full Proxmox REST API passthrough

## Repository Layout

- `cmd/` contains CLI command definitions, argument parsing, confirmation
  prompts, and command-level tests.
- `internal/pve/` contains the Proxmox backend, guest services, task handling,
  and `go-proxmox` wrappers.
- `internal/config/` contains YAML config loading, saving, context selection,
  and token-secret environment resolution.
- `internal/output/` contains table, JSON, and YAML rendering.
- `docs/usage.md` contains the complete command reference.
- `README.md` should stay short and focused on the main HomeLab path.

## Development Rules

- Preserve existing CLI compatibility unless a task explicitly asks for a
  breaking change.
- Prefer the existing flow: `cmd -> internal/pve service -> go-proxmox`.
- Reuse the current `Backend`, `Guest`, and `Task` abstractions for tests.
- Avoid adding controllers, repositories, use cases, policy engines, servers,
  databases, or other platform-style layers.
- Keep `guest` commands read-only unless a future task explicitly changes the
  scope.
- Keep dangerous operations explicit and locally confirmed unless the existing
  `--force` behavior already applies.
- Keep command output script-friendly: command results go to stdout; task IDs
  and wait progress go to stderr.

## Documentation Rules

- Keep README examples focused on daily usage: node list, guest list/get,
  start, shutdown, reboot, and stop.
- Put clone, config, resize, migrate, snapshot, delete, output formats, and
  scripting details in `docs/usage.md`.
- Keep dangerous commands such as delete and snapshot rollback separate from
  daily examples.

## Security Rules

- Never commit API token secrets or real credentials.
- Config files should store only `token_secret_env`, not token secret values.
- Prefer examples that use placeholder endpoints, token IDs, and environment
  variable names.

## Common Commands

```bash
make fmt
make check
make test
make build
```

For documentation-only changes, `git diff --check` is sufficient unless the
task asks for broader validation.
